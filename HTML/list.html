    <h1>Abut football</h1>
    <p>A football is an oval-like inflated ball usually made of cowhide or rubber. The offense, or the team with control of the ball, attempts to advance the ball down the field by running or passing the ball, while the opposing team aims to stop their advance and tries to take control of the ball.</p>
